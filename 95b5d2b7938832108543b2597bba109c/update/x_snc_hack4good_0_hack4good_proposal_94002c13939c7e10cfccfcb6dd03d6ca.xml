        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>A digital platform that matches professionals across industries with students seeking career, academic, or life guidance. Students create profiles with their interests and goals, and professionals volunteer as mentors for regular calls, chats, motivational sessions, and skill-building activities. The platform automates matching, scheduling, feedback collection, and progress tracking to make mentorship easy and impactful.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Students from disadvantaged backgrounds often lack access to positive role models, career guidance, and professional connections. This gap leads to lower motivation, missed opportunities, and difficulty navigating academic and career choices. Existing mentorship programs are limited, hard to access, and rarely personalized to a student’s interests or community.</problem_statement>
