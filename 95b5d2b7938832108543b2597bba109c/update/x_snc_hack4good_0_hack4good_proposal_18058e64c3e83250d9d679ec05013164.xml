<p><strong>Faster Employment:</strong> Shorten the average time from release to securing a job by having verified credentials and applications ready.</p>
<p><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduce the financial burden on the justice system by lowering the number of individuals who return to prison.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>When people leave prison, they have no job skills or official papers (IDs, diplomas) and struggle to find a stable job or home. This difficulty forces them back into old criminal habits, causing them to return to prison (recidivism) repeatedly.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A secure, controlled platform for correctional and re-entry services to manage and deliver educational training, securely store digital credentials, and automate pre-release service applications:</p>
<ul><li><strong>HR Service Delivery (HRSD) - Learning:</strong> Used to deliver digital literacy and vocational training modules within the secure correctional network and track certification progress.</li><li><strong>Secure Case Management (CSM/Custom App):</strong> Manages a secure &#34;Digital Wallet&#34; for each participant to store verified copies of general education development, vocational certifications, and government IDs (like birth certificates) before release.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer &amp; IntegrationHub:</strong> Automates the bureaucratic processes: Pre-populating forms for housing assistance, driver&#39;s license applications, and job placement services before the individual is even released.</li><li><strong>Public Sector Digital Services (PSDS):</strong> Provides the necessary framework for secure interaction with government identity and benefit agencies.</li></ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p>No technical dependencies highlighted for this solution</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>This is the biggest challenge establishing trust between the justice system, participants (former inmates), and external employers/government agencies regarding the security and integrity of the data will require extensive auditing and clear, transparent privacy policies.</p>
<p>Many facilities lack the necessary hardware (tablets, secure computer labs) or robust intranet infrastructure to run the HRSD learning modules effectively. </p>]]></solution_proposal>
