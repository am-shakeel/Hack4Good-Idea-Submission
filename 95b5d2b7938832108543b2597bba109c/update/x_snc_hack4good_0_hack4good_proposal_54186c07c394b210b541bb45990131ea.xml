        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>If taking care of health of employees can be made so friendly in the unified ServiceNow platform itself that would help coordination among project management, emergency leave management and employee health management making the seamless/automated for both employee and organization.</p>
<p>This way an organization would not only be taking care of it&#39;s employees at the time of urgent need but also have a healthy working environment.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>On office days if an employee does not feel well it is very difficult to communicate with projects/HR along with managing doctors appointment Every organization can have a employee health assistance portal which an employee can access on start of his/her day and provide some predefined heath questions about how he/she is feeling that day. Based on the answers having predefined weightage a health score will be calculated by the system with Green/Amber/Red color notation. If the score is low (Amber/Red) it will notify the project manager/HR and will also schedule an immediate appointment with on premises office doctor or it can give option to the employee to schedule an doctor appointment with the tied/insurance company approved hospitals via video call or in person visit.&#13;
&#13;
If the health score is very low an automatic emergency leave submission can also be done in the system notifying/seeking approval for project manager/HR.</problem_statement>
