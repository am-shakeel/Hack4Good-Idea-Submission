        <problem_statement>Charities get a lot of stuff they don't need and not enough of the stuff they actually do. This app fixes that by creating a public "wishlist" so people know exactly what to donate.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>The charity posts its wishlist on a public website.</li><li>You visit the site, pick an item you want to donate, and pledge it.</li><li>The list updates automatically.</li><li>You get a confirmation email telling you where to drop it off.</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>The core solution does not require any external technical integrations to function and can be developed entirely within the platform.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><ol><li>Keeping the list fresh: The charity must keep the wishlist updated, or the whole thing is useless.</li><li>Pledge no-shows: Some people will pledge to donate but never show up.</li><li>Getting people to use it: You have to tell the community to check the website first instead of just dropping off random bags of stuff.</li><li>It doesn&#39;t stop random donations: People will still drop off things that aren&#39;t on the list, so the charity still has to sort donations.</li></ol>]]></solution_proposal>
