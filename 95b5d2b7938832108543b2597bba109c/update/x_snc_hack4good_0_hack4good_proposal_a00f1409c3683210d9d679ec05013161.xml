<p><strong>Equity:</strong> Ensure all students, regardless of parental tech literacy or income, have equal access to functioning learning tools.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>The digital learning gap is preventing students from succeeding. School districts that provide devices (laptops, tablets) to students struggle to manage them. Devices break or fail at home, but there is no simple way for parents or students to get immediate technical support, track repair status, or quickly get a replacement. This chaos in asset management creates long delays, interrupted learning, and unequal educational outcomes.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A digital platform designed to manage the entire lifecycle of student technology assets and provide seamless support, making tech failures a minor inconvenience, not a learning disaster:</p>
<ul><li><strong>IT Asset Management (ITAM):</strong> Tracks every device (laptops, hotspots) issued to a student (the asset&#39;s user), allowing the district to know exactly what is deployed, who has it, and its warranty/repair history.</li><li><strong>Service Catalog &amp; Service Portal:</strong> A dedicated, simple portal and mobile app for parents/students to report a broken device, request a repair, or ask for help (like needing a hotspot). This replaces phone calls and paper forms.</li><li><strong>Customer Service Management (CSM):</strong> Handles the student&#39;s request as a support case. The CSM case automatically pulls the device&#39;s history from ITAM, guiding the support agent to the fastest resolution (e.g., &#34;This device is under warranty, issue a replacement immediately&#34;).</li><li><strong>Flow Designer &amp; Now Mobile:</strong> Automates the physical exchange process: generating shipping labels for returns and triggering an alert to the nearest school warehouse for device replacement pickup.</li></ul>
