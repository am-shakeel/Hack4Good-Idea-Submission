        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>We could have volunteers teaching online using some platform. It would allow volunteers to connect to people from different countries and timezones.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>We need to conduct a research to understand if the target community have access to computers and internet. When they have access to devices connected to the Internet, there would be a need to find a partner to provide quality material for both teachers and students.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>1) Find a partner to provide quality material like books and audio files containing real life scenarios<br />2) Develop a platform to have a database of English native speaker volunteers<br />3) Identify the first groups/communities willing to attend the classes <br />4) Develop a consistent study plan to follow and how to measure success</p>]]></solution_proposal>
