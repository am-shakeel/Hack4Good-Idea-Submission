        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p>All over the world, artisans will earn more money, middlemen will take less profit, and buyers will get authentic products. This also helps keep traditional crafts alive. </p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>Many rural artisans make beautiful crafts but cannot easily sell them. They have trouble finding buyers, keeping quality high, and handling delivery or returns. Buyers also don’t know where to find trusted artisans.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Create a centralized platform through ServiceNow where artisans can join, show their products, and get orders. The system will check product quality, manage returns, and connect artisans with NGOs for training. It will also link to delivery services and payment systems, so everything runs smoothly. </p>
<ul><li><strong>Service Catalog</strong> – to list products and allow bulk orders</li><li><strong>Various ServiceNow Tables</strong> – to store artisan profiles, product details, and quality checks</li><li><strong>Customer Service Management (CSM)</strong> – for buyer support, to resolve disputes</li><li><strong>IntegrationHub</strong> – to connect with e-commerce sites and payment applications</li><li><strong>Performance Analytics</strong> – to track sales, returns, and training progress</li></ul>
<p> </p>

<h3>Are there any technical dependencies for the proposed solution?</h3>
<p></p><p>Yes, there are like e-commerce APIs, payment gateway integration, seller identity checks.</p>
<p> </p>
<hr style="border-top: 3px solid #bbb;" />
<h3>What challenges would you foresee in implementing this idea?</h3>
<p></p><p>Making sure prices are fair, keeping product quality consistent, handling returns, and following rules for selling across borders.</p>]]></solution_proposal>
