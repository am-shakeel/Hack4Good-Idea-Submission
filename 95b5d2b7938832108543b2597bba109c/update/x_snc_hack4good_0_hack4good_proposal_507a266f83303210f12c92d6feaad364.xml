        <problem_statement>Students interested in law often struggle to find mentors, understand career paths, or access real-world exposure. Legal education is theory-heavy, and many youth don’t know how to explore fields like cyber law, IP law, human rights, or corporate law. NGOs and law schools want to guide them, but lack scalable, trackable tools. Sponsors want to support legal talent but lack visibility into engagement.&#13;
This leads to missed opportunities, low confidence, and underrepresentation in legal careers.</problem_statement>
