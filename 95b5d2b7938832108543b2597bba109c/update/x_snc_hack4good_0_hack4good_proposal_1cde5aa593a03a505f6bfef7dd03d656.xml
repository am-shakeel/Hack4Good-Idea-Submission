        <problem_statement>In many organizations, employees struggle to find relevant job opportunities due to poorly categorized, lack of intelligent filtering, and limited visibility into internal openings. Existing career portals often present jobs in a generic format, making it difficult for users to search based on skills, departments, domain, work model, location, experience level or career goals. Additionally, the referral process is tedious, with no centralized platform for employees to easily find relevant jobs to refer candidates or track referral status.&#13;
&#13;
This leads to:&#13;
Missed internal opportunities.&#13;
Reduced employee engagement in referral programs.&#13;
Inefficient hiring processes and longer time-to-hire.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>Create a scoped application with following components:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Tables</strong>: Create custom tables for Job posting, Categories, Applications and Referrals.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer:</strong> Workflows for job posting approvals, application processing, and referral workflows.</li><li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Configure email notifications for job postings, applications, and referral updates.</li><li><strong>Service Portal: </strong>Build an intuitive public portal which provides a simple way to search and filter job openings with different search criteria. Job openings should display all relevant details. Provide an easy interface for employees to refer and track their referral request status.</li><li><strong>Catalog Items: </strong>Catalog Items for HR/Managers to post jobs, users to apply, and employees to refer.</li><li><strong>Dashboards &amp; Analytics:</strong> Dashboards to track portal usage, hiring success rates, and referral effectiveness</li><li><strong>Integration with HRDS:</strong> Integrate the application with ServiceNow HRSD application or third part HRSD platform for smother onboarding of employees. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
