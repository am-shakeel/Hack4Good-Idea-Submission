        <potential_impact><![CDATA[<p><strong>Speed and Efficiency:</strong> Drastically reduce the time from citizen report to resolution (e.g., pothole fixed in 48 hours, not 3 weeks).</p>
<p><strong>Reduced Costs:</strong> Eliminate duplicate reports and save staff time currently spent answering status calls.</p>
<p><strong>Increased Citizen Trust:</strong> Provide full transparency, allowing citizens to see that their report was received, assigned, and fixed.</p>]]></potential_impact>
        <problem_statement>City services are slow to fix local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and illegal dumping. When citizens report a problem, it often gets lost between departments (e.g., the call center, public works, sanitation). There is no simple way to submit a request, no central tracking, and no feedback loop, leading to frustration, duplicate reports, and delayed fixes that impact safety and city finances.</problem_statement>

        <solution_proposal><![CDATA[<h2><strong>How do you envision the ideal solution to this  problem?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Which ServiceNow products or capabilities would be used?</h3>
<p></p><p>A unified, mobile-first platform that funnels all citizen reports into a single, automated workflow, ensuring fast assignment and transparent resolution:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Customer Service Management (CSM):</strong> Every citizen submission (a pothole report, a broken pipe) is instantly logged as a Case, ensuring end-to-end tracking and ownership.</li><li><strong>Service Portal &amp; Now Mobile:</strong> Citizens submit a request in under 60 seconds using a simple form on a mobile app, attaching photos and GPS coordinates. They can track its status 24/7.</li><li><strong>Flow Designer:</strong> Automatically routes the Case (e.g., &#34;Pothole&#34; goes to Roads Dept, &#34;Water Leak&#34; goes to Utility Dept) and assigns it to the correct technician, generating a Field Service Work Order.</li><li><strong>Geolocation &amp; CMDB:</strong> Uses GPS data to map the location of the issue and check it against existing city assets (like a streetlight CI), improving dispatch efficiency and helping city planners track problem areas.</li></ul>
